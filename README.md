# Question: How do you determine the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to the problem of determining the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount. The code defines two functions: `minCoins` and `findMinCoins`. The `minCoins` function is a recursive function that takes three parameters: an array of coin denominations, the length of the array, and a value V representing the target amount. If the target amount is zero, the function returns zero. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `res` to the maximum possible number. It then iterates over the array of coins. If a coin's value is less than or equal to the target amount, it recursively calls `minCoins` with the target amount reduced by the coin's value. If the result of the recursive call is not the maximum possible number and is less than the current value of `res`, `res` is updated to be one more than the result of the recursive call. The function finally returns `res`, which represents the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount. The `findMinCoins` function defines an array of coin denominations, calls `minCoins` with this array and a target amount of 93, and logs the result to the console.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript solution uses a class-based approach to solve the problem, while the JavaScript solution uses a procedural approach. The TypeScript solution encapsulates the coins and memoization map within the `CoinChange` class, providing a clear separation of concerns and making the code more maintainable and reusable.

The TypeScript solution also uses a `Map` for memoization, which is a more modern and efficient data structure for this purpose compared to the array used in the JavaScript solution. The `Map` object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys, which can be beneficial in certain use cases.

Another difference is that the TypeScript solution uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the coins, which is more readable and less error-prone than the traditional `for` loop used in the JavaScript solution.

The TypeScript solution also includes type annotations, which provide static type checking and can help catch errors at compile-time rather than at runtime. This can make the code more robust and easier to debug.

In terms of functionality, both solutions solve the problem in a similar way, using a recursive approach to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount. However, the TypeScript solution returns -1 for amounts that cannot be made up from the given coins, while the JavaScript solution returns `Number.MAX_VALUE` in such cases.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, while the JavaScript version uses a recursive approach. 

In the C++ version, a vector `dp` is created with a size of `amount + 1` and all elements initialized to `amount + 1`. This vector is used to store the minimum number of coins needed to make up each possible amount up to the given amount. The `dp` vector is then filled up by iterating over each possible amount and for each amount, iterating over each coin. If a coin is less than or equal to the current amount, the minimum number of coins needed to make up the current amount is updated to be the minimum of the current value and the number of coins needed to make up the amount minus the current coin plus one. The final result is then the value at `dp[amount]` if it is less than or equal to the amount, or `-1` if it is greater than the amount, indicating that the amount cannot be made up by the given coins.

In the JavaScript version, the function `minCoins` is called recursively with the given amount minus each coin that is less than or equal to the amount. The minimum number of coins needed to make up the given amount is then the minimum of the current minimum and the number of coins needed to make up the amount minus the current coin plus one.

The C++ version uses the `vector` data structure and the `min` function from the standard library, while the JavaScript version uses the `Number.MAX_VALUE` constant and the `console.log` function to print the result. The C++ version also uses the `cin` and `cout` streams for input and output, while the JavaScript version does not require any user input.
